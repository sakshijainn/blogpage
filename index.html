                <h1>Can you relate to the Light of a Star?</h1>
                <p>A star , itself brings a smile on the face of millions of people. Who knows may be it also has its own journey‚Ä¶ We, yes you and me admires its shine , the way it lightens and vanishes the dark side all of around! But as much I know journey? every letter of this word is build with a lot of patience and hardships. Do we ever wonder the shine we see is more of the part of its dedication to stay constant in its journey.</p>
                <p>Yes I am talking about a star. May be the immense glow we pleasantly see is the residual of you know ‚Äò a desire to reach at that point, however ‚Äô</p>

                <h1>Friendship-Beautiful Word?</h1>
                <p>So, heard about friendship a lot! A very dreamy word, or an imaginary tie that everyone wants to have with someone in this life!The tie that understands you,loves you and cares for you endlessly!Do such thing exists? If yes,then ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù is another word for ‚Äù friendship‚Äù.</p>
                <p>So all this was the theoritical crap everyone wants to feel. Giving in a lot to the bond is all we learned about the friendship! Who says we don‚Äôt expect in friendship?whoever says actually lies to himself.</p>
                <p>Obviously giving in so much would expect something in return. In return? What ?</p>
